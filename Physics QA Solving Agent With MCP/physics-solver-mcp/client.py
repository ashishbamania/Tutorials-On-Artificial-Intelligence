        A roller coaster car with a mass of 800 kg starts from rest at the top of a hill that is 50 meters high.
        The car then descends the hill and reaches a velocity of 25 m/s at the bottom.
        
        Given:
        - Mass of the car: 800 kg
        - Initial height: 50 m
        - Final velocity: 25 m/s
        - Gravitational acceleration: 9.81 m/sÂ²
        
        Questions:
        1. Calculate the initial gravitational potential energy of the car at the top of the hill.
        2. Calculate the final kinetic energy of the car at the bottom of the hill.
        3. Compare the initial potential energy with the final kinetic energy and explain any differences.
        4. If the car were to climb another hill, what maximum height could it reach if all its kinetic energy were converted back to potential energy?
